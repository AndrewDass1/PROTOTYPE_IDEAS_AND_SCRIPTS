# Name the 50 States

This script asks to input every state and capital separately. Try your best to enter a state and its matching capital afterwards or a capital and its matching state afterwards! Once every state and capital is entered, it outputs in what order each state and capital was entered, and also another separate list with every state and its matching capital to see if the inputted states and capitals are off from the official state and capital list.

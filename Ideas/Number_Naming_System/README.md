# Number Naming System

Work in progress. The goal is to input any number, no matter how many digits the number may have, return its proper name for it. For example, if an input is 100,000 the script will output 0ne Hundred Thousand. This script will be useful for larger numbers that people may struggle knowing a large number's name.

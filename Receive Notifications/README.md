# 20-20-20 Rule

This script implements a message that should be automated to remind someone to follow the 20-20-20 rule. Since computers or laptops are often used for work, a potential concern is, people may stare at screens for excessive amount of times without taking a break. The 20-20-20 rule means every 20 minutes, take 20 seconds to not look at a bright screen but instead look at an object 20 feet away from them for those 20 seconds. Once 20 seconds has passed, it is time to return to work. The 20-20-20 rule is effective for giving the eyes a short break and not overstrain it.
